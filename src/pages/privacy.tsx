                    On our Website, we use cookies that are temporarily stored in the working memory
                    (&quot;session cookie&quot;) or permanently stored on the hard disk
                    (&quot;permanent cookie&quot;). Cookies are small text files that are
                    automatically created by the browser and stored on your end device (laptop,
                    tablet, smartphone or similar) when you visit our Website. These files allow us
                    to design the Website more efficiently. Most of the cookies we use are Session
                    Cookies, which are only stored in the working memory, but not on your hard
                    drive, and which expire when you close your internet browser and are therefore
                    automatically deleted. Other cookies remain on the device you are using, so that
                    you will be recognized the next time you visit.

                    The setting of the aforementioned cookies is necessary for the proper
                    functioning of the Website. We therefore have a legitimate interest in their
                    use. The legal basis for the related data processing is therefore Art. 6 para. 1

                    optimize our offer, as well as marketing cookies to display information and
                    personalized content tailored specifically to you. These cookies are only set if
                    you have expressly consented to them. You can declare your withdrawal at any

                    or a notice always appears before a new cookie is set. However, the complete
                    deactivation of cookies can cause that you cannot use all the functions of our
