### Community Spotlight: Thorsten Mueller 🇩🇪💬

This month we wanted to shine our spotlight on Thorsten Mueller. Thorsten has been
“fighting the good fight” for open speech for some time now, creating free open
high-quality German TTS voices. Here is a prime example of his work

As you can tell from the quality of TTS voices he’s created, his passion for open
speech has led him to produce models that are basically indistinguishable from
humans. Quite an achievement! 👏👏👏

Not only does Thorsten create flawless TTS models and release them under an open
license for the good of open speech, he teaches others how to do the same!
He's created a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/ThorstenMueller/videos)
that walks you through the details of how he gets his TTS to “sing”.

I don’t know how he finds the time to juggle all of this and a full-time job! Hats
off to Thorsten! We’re lucky to have him as part of our community!💥🔥💯👏👏👏

### &#35;HackThePlanet HaCkAtHoN 😼💻

By [Coqui🐸](https://github.com/coqui-ai)

Mozilla and Coqui teamed up to #HackThePlanet, staging a unique hackathon focused
on building real, voice-enabled products.

Participants pulled down pre-trained speech-to-text and text-to-speech models and
went to work building product! (None of that pesky machine learning getting in
the way!😉)

The creativity of the participants was reflected in the breadth of ideas considered:

- TTS for people who have lost the power of speech
- STT + Translation engine for people who share no common language
- STT plugin to transcribe meetings for video conferencing platforms
- Along with many others, too many to mention!

However, the winner wasn’t judged on creativity alone, but on creativity _and_ execution,
and Team Tichyen executed, creating [3d-voice-chess](https://github.com/HarikalarKutusu/3d-voice-chess)
a 3D voice powered chess game in the blink of an eye. All hail Team Tichyen! And all
hail all the other teams that participated! 👏👏👏
