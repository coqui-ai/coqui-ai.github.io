_“Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life, or do you want to come with me and change the world?”_
– Steve Jobs

Are you looking for something completely new, the chance to build “from the ground-up” an MLOps provisioning system
that can scale and is cloud agnostic?

If so, you should join Coqui as part of our MLOps Team. At Coqui we’re looking to redefine how humans interact with
computers through that most natural of interfaces, speech, and we require the skills of a senior MLOps engineer to
build “ground-up” our provisioning system. Interested?

By the way, at Coqui we don’t sell sugar water.
