Coqui is a polyglot! Now we support multiple languages!

- Our emotive, immersive voices are now in **English, German, French, Spanish, Italian,
  Portuguese, and Polish with more on the way!**
- All default voices now speak all supported languages! (Localization just got _much_
  easier.)
- Any XTTS clone can now speak any supported language! (Dubbing you‚Äôve dreamt of!)
- Any XTTS voice you‚Äôve built, either through prompt-to-voice or the voice-builder, now
  speaks any supported language! (Magic!)

Coqui, world leader in open source speech, just threw open its doors to the
languages of the world, adding support for **English, German, French, Spanish,
Italian, Portuguese, and Polish with more languages on the way!**

Whatever your use case (video game voice over, audio post production, dubbing,
localization, podcasts, audiobooks‚Ä¶) you‚Äôll benefit from multiple languages;
multiply your audience many times over with the click of a button.

All of the emotive, immersive default voices now speak all supported languages.
So (whether it‚Äôs Maja Ruoho, Gitta Nikolina, or any other default voice) they‚Äôre all
polyglots! Beyond that, any XTTS clone you‚Äôve created is also, with no effort on
your part, a polyglot! So too are any XTTS voices you‚Äôve built with prompt-to-voice
or the voice-builder. They‚Äôre all polyglots!
