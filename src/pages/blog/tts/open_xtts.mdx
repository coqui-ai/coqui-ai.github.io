### XTTS a Labour of Love

The foundation model XTTS is the culmination of years of work by the Coqui team and is able to
outperform both open and closed models in a broad range of tasks. For example:

- **Quality** - XTTS generates speech that meets and exceeds **production-quality** requirements.
- **Multilingual** - XTTS generates speech in **13 different languages** (Arabic, Brazilian
  Portuguese, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Russian, Spanish,
  and Turkish). More to come!
- **Voice Cloning** - XTTS **clones any voice** using only a small sample of the original voice,
  i.e. you give a voice sample in German and you can create a clone that sounds like the
  original voice speaking German.
- **Cross Language Voice Cloning** - XTTS **clones across languages**, i.e. you give a voice
  sample in German and you can create a clone that sounds like the original voice speaking any
  of the other languages (Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, English, French,
  Italian, Polish, Russian, Spanish, Turkish).

Coqui‚Äôs innovation is not limited to only the foundation model XTTS. Coqui is also innovating
in open source model licensing. (Currently, open _model_ licensing, not open _source_ licensing,
is _very_ broken.)

Working with [Heather Meeker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heathermeeker/), world-leading expert
on open source licenses, Coqui has created a new, innovative model license, the Coqui Public
Model License (CPML), and XTTS will be the first ever model released under the CPML! You can
read more about the Coqui Public Model License (CPML) [here](/cpml).

Enterprises, if you‚Äôre interested in licensing the model, fine-tuned versions of the model, or
other model variants under other licensing terms, just reach out licensing@coqui.ai.
